# Note Taker

## Description

**11 Express.js: Note Taker** is an application designed to write and save notes, utilizing an **Express.js** backend to manage the retrieval and storage of note data from a JSON file. The front-end interface was already provided, and my task was to build the backend, connect the two, and deploy the entire application on Render.
